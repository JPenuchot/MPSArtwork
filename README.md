# MPSArtwork
Artwork originally made for a collaboration between MPSA and Eclecticism. It is a cellular automata that is meant to represent a forest fire that is then exported into a video file or rendered in real-time.

OpenCV is used for both image display and video writing for the sake of simplicity. Nothing much is required except CMake and OpenCV.
